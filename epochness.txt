The Epochness library is intended for use in applications where high precision time measurements are needed.

The library works in time "ticks", where 1 tick is less than 1 microsecond

The frequency of these ticks is constant and is stored in the library, so tick values can be converted into second values

Here is a code example that will make a timer run for 10 seconds:

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
	// initialize library
	Epoch_Init();

	// new clock
	Epoch_t clock;
	// start clock
	Epoch_Start(&clock);

	// # of seconds that have passed
	int seconds = 0;
	// change in ticks
	epoch_int d_ticks = 0;

	while (seconds < 10)
	{
		// get # of ticks since last time we checked
		d_ticks += Epoch_QueryChange(&clock);

		if (d_ticks >= Epoch_TicksPerSecond())
		{
			d_ticks -= Epoch_TicksPerSecond();
			seconds++;
			printf("%d\n", seconds);
		}
	}

	printf("Done!\n");

	return 0;
}
